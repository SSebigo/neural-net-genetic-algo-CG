# Onboarding Neural Network

## What is it?

This is a simple project in my attempt to learn Rust language.

It consist in a Feed Forward Neural Network (Multi Layer Perceptron) and a Genetic Algorithm.<br/>
The Genetic Algorithm is used to select the best fitting neural nets, breed them and mutate the newly created neural nets.

Note: Most of the values used in my code are arbitrary.
